# That-Really-Grind-My-Gears
A PHP api that will let you know what really x's my y

Based on Chewsterchew's [TRBMB](https://github.com/Chewsterchew/TRBMB-Gen) but remade in PHP.

This was made to replace Chewsterchew's API which wouldn't work all the time and frequently disconnect.

You can try it in [Bryonato's twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/bryonato) by typing "!hello"
